# Hi, I’m Rohadi 👋

## 🧭 About Me
I work at the intersection of **technology, systems, and decision-making**.

I started as a developer, but over time my focus shifted from just building features to designing **reliable workflows, automation, and decision-support systems** that remain useful under real-world constraints.

I use technology — including AI — as an assistant to reduce noise, clarify options, and support better end-to-end decisions, not as a replacement for thinking.
